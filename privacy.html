										<h4>Information You Provide to Us</h4>
										<div class="details">
											
												<p>We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create or modify your account, request on-demand services, contact customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. This information may include: name, email, phone number, postal address, profile picture, payment method, and other information you choose to provide.</p>

										<h4>Information We Collect Through Your Use of Our Services</h4>
										<div class="details">
											
												<p>When you use our Services, we collect information about you in the following general categories:</p>
											
												<p>Location Information: When you use the Services, we collect precise location data from the KaChick app. If you permit the KaChick app to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system (“platform”), we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.</p>
											
												<p>Contacts Information: If you permit the KaChick app to access the address book on your device through the permission system used by your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our Services and for other purposes described in this Statement or at the time of consent or collection.</p>
											
												<p>Transaction Information: We collect transaction details related to your use of our Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, and other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your promo code, we may associate your name with that person.</p>
											
												<p>Usage and Preference Information: We collect information about how you and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. To learn more about these technologies, please see our Cookie Statement.</p>
											
												<p>Device Information: We may collect information about your mobile device, including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software and file names and verions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information.</p>
											
												<p>Call and SMS Data: Our Services facilitate communications between Users and Photographers. In connection with facilitating this service, we receive call data, including the date and time of the call or SMS message, the parties’ phone numbers, and the content of the SMS message.</p>
											
												<p>Log Information: When you interact with the Services, we collect server logs, which may include information like device IP address, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and the third-party site or service you were using before interacting with our Services.</p>

								<h3>Important Information About Platform Permissions</h3>
								<!-- h3 > p Starts -->
								
									<div class="details">
										
											<p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the KaChick app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the KaChick app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent. To learn about the platform-level permissions that the app seeks, please visit our new iOS Permissions page and Android Permissions page. Sometimes these permissions require more explanation than the platforms themselves provide, and the permissions we request will change over time, so we’ve created these pages to serve as authoritative and up-to-date resources for our users.</p>

								<h3>Information We Collect From Other Sources</h3>
								<!-- h3 > p Starts -->
								
									<div class="details">
										
											<p>We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example: </p>
										
											<p>If you choose to link, create, or log in to your KaChick account with a payment provider (e.g., Google Wallet) or social media service (e.g., Facebook), or if you engage with a separate app or website that uses our API (or whose API we use), we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or app.</p>
										
											<p>When you request on demand services, our Photographers may provide us with a User rating after providing services to you.</p>
										
											<p>If you also interact with our Services in another capacity, for instance as a Photographer or user of other apps we provide, we may combine or associate that information with information we have collected from you in your capacity as a User.</p>

										<h4>Information We Collect Through Your Use of Our Services</h4>
										<div class="details">
											
												<p>When you use our Services, we collect information about you in the following general categories:</p>
											
												<p>Location Information: As a condition of providing Users with photography services via the KaChick platform, your precise location data must be provided to KaChick via the app that that you use. Once the KaChick app has permission to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system (“platform”), we will collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.</p>
											
												<p>Contacts Information: If you permit the KaChick app to access the address book on your device via the permission system used by your platform, we may access and store names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our Services and for other purposes described in this Statement or at the time of consent or collection.</p>
											
												<p>Transaction Information: We collect transaction details related to the photography services you provide through our platform, including the type of service provided, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, and other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your promo code, we may associate your name with that person.</p>
											
												<p>Usage and Preference Information: We collect information about how you and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar device identification technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. To learn more about these technologies, please see our Cookie Statement.</p>
											
												<p>Device Information: We may collect information about your mobile device (whether your own device or a device we provide you), including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software and file names and versions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information.</p>

								<h3>Important Information About Platform Permissions</h3>
								<!-- h3 > p Starts -->
								
									<div class="details">
										
											<p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the KaChick app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the KaChick app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent.</p>

								<h3>Information We Collect From Other Sources</h3>

									<div class="details">
										
											<p>We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example: </p>
										
											<p>If you choose to link, create, or log in to your KaChick account with a payment provider (e.g., Google Wallet) or social media service (e.g., Facebook), or if you engage with a separate app or website that uses our API (or whose API we use), we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or app.</p>
										
											<p>If you use the Services through an account associated with a partner company, we may receive information about you from that partner company.</p>
										
											<p>When you provide on demand services to Users, our Users may provide us with a rating or similar rating of the service you provide for them.</p>
										
											<p>If you also interact with our Services in another capacity, for instance to request on demand services as a User, or as a user of other apps we may provide, we may combine or associate that information with information we have collected from you in your capacity as a Photographer.</p>

				<p class="description">We and our affiliates, third parties, and other partners use cookies and other identification technologies on our websites, mobile applications, electronic communications, advertisements, and other online services (collectively, the &#34;Services&#34;) for a number of purposes, including: authenticating users, remembering user preferences and settings, determining the popularity of content, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, analyzing site traffic and trends, and generally understanding the online behaviors and interests of people who interact with our Services.

								<h3>Cookies Overview</h3>
								<!-- h3 > p Starts -->
								
									<div class="details">
										
											<p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your browser or device by websites, apps, online media, and advertisements. There are different types of cookies. Cookies served by the entity that operates the domain you are visiting are called “first party cookies.” So cookies served by KaChick while you are on www.KaChick.com are first party cookies. Cookies served by companies that are not operating the domain you’re visiting are called “third party cookies.” So, we may allow Google to set a cookie on your browser while you visit www.KaChick.com, and that would be a third party cookie. Cookies may also endure for different periods of time. “Session Cookies” only last only as long as your browser is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are “persistent cookies” meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. For example, they may recognize your device when you re-open your browser and browse the internet again.</p>

								<h3>Other Identification Technologies</h3>
								<!-- h3 > p Starts -->
								
									<div class="details">
										
											<p>identification technologies we may use or permit on our Services. “Pixel tags” (also called beacons or pixels) are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a webpage, app, or advertisement which can retrieve certain information about your device and browser, including for example: device type, operating system, browser type and version, website visited, time of visit, referring website, IP address, and other similar information, including the small text file (the cookie) that uniquely identifies the device. Pixels provide the means by which third parties can set and read browser cookies from a domain that they do not themselves operate and collect information about visitors to that domain, typically with the permission of the domain owner. “Local storage” refers generally to other places on a browser or device where information can be stored by websites, ads, or third parties (such as HTML5 local storage and browser cache). “Software Development Kits” (also called SDKs) function like pixels and cookies, but operate in the mobile app context where pixels and cookies cannot always function. The primary app developer can install pieces of code (the SDK) from partners in the app, and thereby allow the partner to collect certain information about user interaction with the app and information about the user device and network information.</p>

								<h3>Your Choices</h3>

									<div class="details">
										
											<p>You have the right to choose whether or not to accept cookies. However, they are an important part of how our Services work, so you should be aware that if you choose to refuse or remove cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of the Services. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. To do so, please follow the instructions provided by your browser which are usually located within the &#34;Help&#34; or “Preferences” menu. Some third parties also provide the ability to refuse their cookies directly by clicking on an opt-out link, and we have indicated where this is possible in the table above.</p>
										
											<p>Removing or rejecting browser cookies does not necessarily affect third-party flash cookies which may be used by us or our partners in connection with our Services. To delete or disable flash cookies please visit this site for more information.
