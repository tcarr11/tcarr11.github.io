							<div class="details">
								
									<p>You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from a Third Party Provider (“Charges ”). After you have confirmed your booking with the Third Party Provider, KaChick will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider as such Third Party Provider’s limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by KaChick. </p>
								
									<p>All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by KaChick using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which KaChick will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that KaChick may, as the Third Party Provider’s limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.</p>
								
									<p>As between you and KaChick, KaChick reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in KaChick’s sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase based on the photographer you book and his / her respective location and serving areas. KaChick will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. KaChick may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider’s arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee.</p>
								
									<p>This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services or goods provided. KaChick does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary.

									<h4>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h4>
									<div class="details">
											<p>These Terms and your use of the Services will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a court in Hong Kong for any actions for which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&#39;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.</p>

									<h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>
									<div class="details">
											<p>You and KaChick agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site (collectively, &#34;Disputes&#34;) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&#39;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and KaChick are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and KaChick otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#39;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this &#34;Dispute Resolution&#34; section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this &#34;Dispute Resolution&#34; section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>

									<h4>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</h4>
									<div class="details">
											<p>Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, including any claim that this Agreement or any part of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or otherwise voidable or void, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules then in force. The appointing authority and the place of arbitration shall be the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre. There shall be only one arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English. Any award of the arbitrator shall be enforceable by any court having jurisdiction over the party against which the award has been rendered.</p>
										
											<p>Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the &#34;Modification&#34; section above, if KaChick changes this &#34;Dispute Resolution&#34; section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the &#34;Last Updated Date&#34; above or in the date of KaChick’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and KaChick in accordance with the provisions of this &#34;Dispute Resolution&#34; section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>

									<h4>General</h4>
									<div class="details">
											<p>The failure of KaChick to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of KaChick. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>

											<p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, under any law, such provision or part thereof shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of these Terms but the legality, validity and enforceability of the other provisions in these Terms shall not be affected. In that event, the parties shall replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or part thereof with a provision or part thereof that is legal, valid and enforceable and that has, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or part thereof, given the contents and purpose of these Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and replaces and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or undertakings regarding such subject matter.
